[23:35:09 +02:00] [Thread 1350154849] Message: Arma Linux Servers are using Older Physic Library (than Windows Servers), due to Debian 7 using old version of Glibc
[23:35:09 +02:00] [Thread 1350154849] Message: If you like extDB consider donating or bug BIS to drop support for Debian 7 thanks, so Linux Servers get same Physic Library Version as Windows
